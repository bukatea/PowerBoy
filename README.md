# PowerBoy
Commercial ATtiny84A-controlled battery management system with indicator lights and wireless charging for the Game Boy Advanceâ„¢

Main code is contained in the PowerBoy1.0 folder. I use felias-fogg's SoftI2CMaster written in AVR ASM (code can be found at https://github.com/felias-fogg/SoftI2CMaster) for I2C communications between the fuel gauge and the ATtiny84A. To code the ATtiny, I use the Arduino IDE as an ISP programmer for the MCU. This is a technical project for two undergraduate students of the New Mexico State University's Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Departments; however, we are not endorsed by them at all. This is a pet project.
